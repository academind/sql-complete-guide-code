# 62. Temporary Tables & Tables From Other Tables

## Temporary tables

Temporary tables, are table store in memory, so the data hold by them will not be persisted.

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE (
);
```

## Tables based on other tables

We can create a table which is based on the results fo a query to another table. This is useful if a subset of data from another table should be stored in a separate table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name AS <query>
```
