# 48. What About Time Zones?

> When working with data types that include a time (like `TIMESTAMP`), the time of course is meaningless unless it's also combined with information about the timezone to which it belongs.
>
> Many SQL database systems, including MySQL & Postgresql, store times in UTC (i.e. using the UTC timezone) internally. Those database systems then automatically "translate" the time you provide or request from / to your local timezone.
>
> So if you insert a time like 16:32:00 and you're located in CEST (Central European Summer Time), then a value of 14:32:00 would be stored internally, as this is the UTC equivalent.
>
> If data is then fetched via SELECT, the time is returned in CEST again. Or, if it's requested from a client located in another timezone, it's returned translated to that timezone's time.
