# 56. We Need Unique Values & Identifiers! <!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD026 -->

It is important to have a unique identifier per each record in our table. We could set the value manually, but, both MySQL and PostgreSQL, have a feature that allows us to set a unique identifier automatically.

## Setting a UNIQUE constraint

In the following example we set a unique constraint, but we still have to manually provide a value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- here we set an integer field wit a unique constraint, that could be used asn a identifier
  full_name VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
  salary INT
);
```

## Automatically generating unique values

This unique, automatically generated, identifier, is named `PRIMARY KEY`, and we can only have one per table. This keyword `PRIMARY KEY`, basically translates to `NOT NULL UNIQUE`, but also as a special meaning that indicate the RDMS that this is the table unique identifier.

### MySQL

We we combine `PRIMARY KEY` with `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute, which will automate the insertion of incrementing values. This attribute is specific to MySQL.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  salary INT
);
```

### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL, and for most other RDMS, we use `SERIAL`, which is a special data type, that creates an auto-incrementing integer.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  full_name VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
  salary INT
);
```

This syntax is also supported by MySQL.
