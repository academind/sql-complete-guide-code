# 32. Deleting Databases & IF NOT EXISTS

> Deleting Databases & `IF NOT EXISTS`
> You typically don't create databases very often - deleting them is (typically) an even rarer event.
>
> Still, if you need to delete a database, this can be done via the `DROP DATABASE <db_name>` command.
>
> As a side-note: If you are creating a database and you want to make sure that you don't get an error, if it already exists (i.e., you want to create a database only if it does not exist yet and continue without any errors otherwise), you can do that by adding `IF NOT EXISTS` to the `CREATE DATABASE` command. This "addition" will also be available when creating tables via `CREATE TABLE` (covered later).
>
> `IF NOT EXISTS` for `CREATE DATABASE` is not available for Postgresql, only for MySQL. `CREATE TABLE`, adding `IF NOT EXISTS` works for both MySQL and Postgresql.
