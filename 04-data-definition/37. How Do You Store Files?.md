# 37. How Do You Store Files?

Databases are not used to store files, like for example a user profile image, we only store in a database, SQL or NoSQL primitive data, like numbers and text. Files are stored on a file server, like AWS S3, or hard drive and only the path to the file is stored in the database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (user_name VARCHAR(255), image_path VARCHAR(200));
```

```sql
INSERT INTO users (user_name, image_path) VALUES ('jmschp', '/uploads/images/jmschp.jpg');
```
