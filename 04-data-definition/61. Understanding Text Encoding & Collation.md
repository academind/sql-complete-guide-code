# 61. Understanding Text Encoding & Collation

## Encoding

Encoding controls what kind fo characters can be stored, and can be set on database, table or column level, depending on RDMS.

Nowadays the most common encoding is UTF-8 ([Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/)), which is the default for both MySQl and PostgreSQL.

## Collation

Collation is about how characters are compared to one another. Can be set on database, table or column level, depending on RDMS.
