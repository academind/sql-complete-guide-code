# 40. Creating a Numeric Value Column

To select the Data Type to work in number there are

- Do we need decimal values?
  - If not go with Sata type **Integer**
- If we need decimal values, do we need them with precision, like for product pricing?
  - If yes go with data type Decimal or Numeric.
  - If not go with data type Float.

For our case we are going to use Integer for the user salary

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  full_name VARCHAR(200),
  year_salary INT,
)
```
