# 39. Creating a First Text Column

To create the **users** table with a column for the user full name, probably the best data type is `VARCHAR`, users name have different lengths, but usually they shouldn't be to long as for a `TEXT` data type, and it is very common that an application as a limit number of characters for the user full name.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  full_name VARCHAR(200)
)
```

Using `VARCHAR(200)`, menns that the user `full_name` can hold up to 200 bits. Depends on the encoding, but usually 1 bit equals 1 character, so 200 characters.
