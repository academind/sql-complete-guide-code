# 57. SERIAL in MySQL vs SERIAL in Postgresql

> As mentioned at the end of the previous lecture, you can use `SERIAL` to define an auto-incrementing number in both MySQL and PostgreSQL (and other) database systems.
>
> However, besides `INT AUTO_INCREMENT` being more popular / used more often in the MySQL world, there also is another important note you should take: `SERIAL` will produce an `INT` value in PostgreSQL (and many other database systems) - but it will give you a `BIGINT` when used in MySQL.
>
> This is something you should keep in mind if you go for `SERIAL` instead of `INT AUTO_INCREMENT` - especially when exploring relationships between records (which we'll do later in the course).
