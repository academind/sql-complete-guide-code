# 52. Dealing With "No Data" (NULL) vs "0"

In some situation it is preferable to have a `NULL` value in a column instead of `0`. For example in the users table we have a column `year_salary` and when a user is in unemployed status is salary is 0. Depending in the use case it might be better to have `NULL` instead of `0`, for example to calculate the the average salaries, we might not want to include `0`.

If we want to use the built-in average function `AVG()`, `NULL` will be ignore, but `0` values will be included.

```sql
SELECT AVG(year_salary) FROM users
```
