# 46. Creating a new Table with Text & Timestamp Data

For the conversations table we need to store information about the user and employer involved in the conversation, the actual message sent and the sate that was sent.

For the `message` column we could use a data type `VARCHAR(2000)` to set a limit to the message size, or use the `TEXT` data type, to allow message of any length.

For the `date_sent` column we can use the built-in `TIMESTAMP` data type, which as date and time information.

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  -- using the same data type as in the table users full_name
  user_name VARCHAR(200),
  -- the matching column in the employers table.
  employer_name VARCHAR(250),
  message TEXT,
  date_sent TIMESTAMP
)
```
