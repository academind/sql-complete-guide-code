# 47. Inserting Data Into The New Tables

Inserting mock data into employers and conversations. For the conversation data we should use an existing user and employer.

The `date_sent`column should have a specific format **aaaa-mm-dd hh:mm:ss** hoursshoulf be in the 24h format.

```sql
INSERT INTO conversations (user_name, employer_name, message, date_sent)
VALUES (
    'Miguel Pimenta',
    'Learning Inc',
    'Hi, I like learning!',
    '2021-10-15 16:32:10'
  );
```
