# 59. Auto-IDs, Primary Keys & Inserting Data

> In the previous lecture, we added auto-incrementing IDs and the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint to `id` columns in the three main tables.
>
> With that set up, you could insert data into these tables like this:
>
> ```sql
> INSERT INTO employers (company_name, company_address, yearly_revenue, is_hiring)
> VALUES ('Some Company Inc', 'Some Street 5, Mycity', 85.91, TRUE);
> ```
>
> Please note that no value is provided for the `id` column - because it's populated automatically.
>
> If you fetch the data for this table (via `SELECT \* FROM employers;`), you can see that a value (1) has been inserted automatically for the `id` column.
>
> If you add another row (via `INSERT INTO` again) and you then fetch all the data again, you see that the first row still has an `id` of 1 but the second row has an `id` of 2 - which was also inserted automatically.
>
> These unique IDs (which are guaranteed to be unique, thanks to `PRIMARY KEY`) can also be used to establish relations between different rows in different tables - though that is a topic we'll dive in in great detail later in the course!
>
> Here's just a quick first example:
>
> ```sql
> INSERT INTO users (full_name, yearly_salary, current_status)
> VALUES ('Frank Meyer', 30000, 'self-employed');
> ```
>
> This would create a new user which receives an `id` automatically. If it's the first user after table creation, the id will be 1.
>
> ```sql
> INSERT INTO conversations (user_id, employer_id, message)
> VALUES (1, 2, 'Hi there!');
> ```
>
> The above command would add a new row into the conversations table - storing the user `id` 1 (i.e. Frank Meyer's id) and the employer `id` 2 (the second employer you might've added).
