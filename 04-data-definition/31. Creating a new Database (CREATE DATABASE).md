# 31. Creating a new Database (CREATE DATABASE)

Command to created the **talently** database. SQL convention for databases names is lower case, and if the name consist of multiple words we should use a underscore to concatenate the words, like for example **talently_pool**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE talently;
```

In the the case of MySQL we could chnage the keyword `DATABASE` to `SCHEMA`, the following statement will have the same effect `CREATE SCHEMA talently;`.
