# 58. Working With Auto Incrementing IDs & Primary Keys

When we are referencing records form one table in another, like in our example, in the `conversations` table we reference the user and the employer, we should use this records `PRIMARY KEY` as the reference. So we point to the `id` column of each record, usually we use as the column name the singular form of the table name suffixed by id. And we set as data type the same as the `id` column in the origin table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  user_id INT, -- We user the same data type as
  employer_id INT,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  date_sent TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```
