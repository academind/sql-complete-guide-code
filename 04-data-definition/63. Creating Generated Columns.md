# 63. Creating Generated Columns

We could use generated columns to save data based on some calculation performed with other columns. For example in the users table we cold have a `first_name` and `last_name` columns, and then automatically populate the `full_name` column. Then in this case we can not manually insert values in `full_name`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  first_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  full_name VARCHAR(401) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name)) -- VARCHAR(401) to and on character for teh whitespace
);
```
